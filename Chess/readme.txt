1. Basic implementation of the playing field:

* Displaying an 8x8 playing field using OpenGL.

* The correct position of the pieces at the starting position.

* Visualization of each piece (pawns, bishops, rooks, knights, queens, kings) using textures.

2. Movement of the figures:

* Processing mouse clicks (using GLFW).

* Defining the selected shape.

* Checking possible moves for the selected piece (algorithm for checking moves).

* Move a piece on the playing field.

* Displays possible moves for the selected piece (for example, highlighting).

3. Implementation of the rules of the game:

* Checking the correctness of a piece's move according to the rules of chess.

* Take-on-pass processing.

* Castling processing.

* Checkmate processing.

* Display of the current player.

4. User Interface (GUI):

* Displaying the progress in text form.

* The ability to save and download batches.

* The ability to select the game mode (against the computer / human).

* The implementation of the ability to make a "undo move".

* The ability to choose the difficulty level (for playing against the computer).

5. Visual effects and sound effects:

* Visualization of taking shapes (for example, animation).

* Using sounds for clicks, moves of pieces, capture, checkmate (using OpenAL).

* Stylish design of the playing field and shapes.

6. The algorithm of the game against the computer:

* Implementation of a simple algorithm for playing against the computer (for example, finding the minimum number of moves).

* Gradual complication of the algorithm depending on the level of complexity.

* The possibility of using the position estimation algorithm.

7. Reliability and efficiency:

* Validation of input data.

* Optimization of algorithms (checking moves, calculating checkmate).

* Minimizing memory usage.

8. Additional features (optional):

* The "fast chess" mode with a time limit.

* Saving the history of the parties.

* The ability to play online.

* The possibility of using different chess variants (for example, with kings).

* Expansion of the functionality depending on the complexity (more advanced algorithms).
