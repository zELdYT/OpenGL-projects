A tutorial like how to make chess in C lol.

1. Creating an interface. No, well, we're not going to play binary chess, right?
2. Creating the logic of chess. This is understandable. The main thing is not to make a mistake and not to make tic-tac-toe or even worse a naval battle.
3. Fix bugs. Well, where can I go without him?????!
4 - 10. Doing, correcting, doing, correcting, doing, correcting.
11. Release. REALLY?????! finally!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

And yes, this is an approximate view of the project. Do not judge strictly (otherwise you will stand in a corner >:) )

UPD (02/11/2024):
I will write program in C.
And what kind of nonsense did I write almost a year ago? People, I am very ashamed (no =) )
